# The `tornado` learning tutorial.

This tutorial has included two parts, that is adopted to the different level of developer who is new into the `asynchronous programming` or `tornado` world. Before start learning this tutorial, you should be  familiar with python programming first.

## Part One: [Python asynchronous programming](./tutorial.md#)

Before we talking about `tornado`, this part will try to introduce the basic concept of python `asynchronous programming` you should know. Though this part learning, using those concepts to help us understand how `tornado` working at asynchronous programming.

This part might adopt to the developer who don't know the modern asynchronous programming of python and want figure out the concepts behind it. But for the person who already know the mechanism of python `asyncio` library, and also can programming code with it, could skip this part.

## Part Two: [Learning `tornado` coroutine mechanism through source code](./tutorial2.md#)

This part will start to taking about how the `tornado` implement its coroutine to achieve asynchronous programming. This is fundamental part of tornado work asynchronous code, and how its extinguish from the `asyncio` library works.

Adopt to the developer who already know the asynchronous programming, or have finished the part one learning.
